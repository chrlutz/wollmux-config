My localization efforts constitute a "work in progress".

Especially for the plugins, a great deal still needs to be translated to English. For now, I have tried to get the main functionality that the user will see in everyday use into English.

There may be some conflict between formularanpassungen.conf and formularmax4000.conf as I have them now.

localization.conf is liable to be updated frequently.
